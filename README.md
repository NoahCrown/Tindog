This website was made under the course "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. 

It taught me the bootstrap framework, how to create responsive websites, refractoring the code to make it more readable and advance CSS concepts such as Selector Priority and Media Query. This is one major step in improving my Web Development Skills as I develop more complex and unique website ideas.
